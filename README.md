# expressjs-router-worker

This module helps newcomers to build one router event if they do not understand the routing.

In fact. It is for my usage, but anyone is welcome to use and/or sugest improvements.

## Example

There is one usage example in ```example_usage.js``` and ```app.js``` files.

## TODO

1. Provide other registering mechanisms or allow to inject a way you want output response.
2. Throw errors in case router is not well configured
